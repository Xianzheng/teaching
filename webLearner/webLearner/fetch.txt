In my experience, data sent using fetch are not located inside request.
POST but rather inside request.body. 
There are then cases where the received data is in byte so you will need to decode it first.
I suggest that you do this first:

fetch post data 不在request.POST里

<script>
    
    const options = {
           method: "POST",

           headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            
            
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({username:'mark'})
        };

           
           
       

       fetch("http://localhost:8000/app/postData/",options)
       .then(res => res.json())
       .then(res => {
        console.log(res)
       })
   </script>
    

def postData_view(request):
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        post_data = json.loads(request.body.decode("utf-8"))
        
        print(post_data)
        
        return HttpResponse(json.dumps('success'))
